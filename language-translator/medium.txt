I have been extensively using Typescript since the beginning of this year. The reason for this can be attributed to its popularity, as it was ranked 4th in Github’s language rankings for 2022. Additionally, it appears on most job descriptions, with over 801,000 job offers explicitly requiring Javascript or Typescript as a programming language between October 2021 and November 2022, accounting for 31% of all job offers. Therefore, it is a language that cannot be ignored. Most importantly though, Typescript is a superset of Javascript, suitable for building large scale applications due to its strongly typed feature that makes debugging easier. It’s javascript with more features. You can compile a program in Javascript and save it as a .ts extension instead of .js and it will work well.
